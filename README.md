# Analysis of Property Prices in Ireland
This is the master thesis in MSc Data Analytics which is based on the property prices in Ireland.

The house prices are increasing every year and it is demanding the analysis and prediction of property prices. The main objective of this study is to perform an initial analysis on the property prices of Ireland from 2010 to 2022 collected from the PSRA website. Factors influencing the house prices county, year, province, location of property, property size and type are considered for analysis. This research will be based on both statistical and machine learning methods to analyse and predict the property prices of Ireland from 2010- 2022 collected from the PSRA website. For statistical analysis I will be using hedonic regression, linear regression, and ANOVA methods. Machine learning methods such as SVM, DT, XG-Boost, and Linear regression (LR) algorithms will be employed to predict the property prices.
