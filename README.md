Analysis of Property Prices in Ireland
This is the master thesis in MSc Data Analytics which is based on the property prices in Ireland.

The house prices are increasing every year since 2012 in Ireland, and it is demanding the analysis and prediction of property prices. 
The main objective of this study is to conduct both statistical and machine learning analysis on the property prices of Ireland from 2010 to 2022 collected from the PSRA website. Factors influencing the house prices county, year, province, location of property, property size and type are considered for analysis. Different machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine regression, Decision Tree, XG Boost, Neural Network, and Random Forest regression were used for analysis to identify the better fit model. Statistical tests and visualizations were generated for the analysing the effect of different attributes on property prices and the results implied that the province, year, property size, and location are statistically significant and are affecting the house prices significantly. The machine learning algorithms XG-Boost, Neural Network and Support Vector Machine was found to be the better algorithms for predicting the property prices based on the R squared and Root Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error values.
